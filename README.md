# Background
Typical programming languages involve complex syntax and structure which can be daunting to first-time programmers. Particularly, elementary-age students may not be able to understand the relationship between a mathematical-looking program and its output. Thus, I created Engram, which teaches both English syntax as well as a version of typical functional programming language syntax. Young English speakers can learn Engram to familiarize themselves with simple English sentence structure and critical programming concepts.

This project has three parts: a parser & compiler, an Integrated Developer Environment for the compiler, and lesson plans. The lexer, parser, and compiler were created using the C++ programming language. The IDE was created using C# and the .NET Framework.

# What is Engram?
Engram is a programming language meant for first-time programmers. Engram is intended for children in elementary school, but its concepts can be useful to anyone interested in learning critical programming language concepts. Unlike other programming languages, Engram is written using simple English sentences. Instead of writing, for instance, `System.out.println("Hello world!");`, Engram programs can be written like this: `Output "Hello world!".`.

I have intentionally kept Engram simple, meaning programmers will not have as much freedom with it when compared to fully-fledged languages like C or Java. However, Engram does support vital functions like variable operations, input/output, functions, and loops. These concepts are taught in detail in the online tutorial, which you can find below.
