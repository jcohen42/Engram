# What is Engram?
A programming language whose syntax is purely English, intended for computer science education. This project has three parts: a parser & compiler, an Integrated Developer Invironment for the compiler, and lesson plans. The lexer, parser, and compiler were created using the C++ programming language. The IDE was created using C# and the .NET Framework.

# Introduction
Typical programming languages involve complex syntax and structure which can be daunting to first-time programmers. Particularly, elementary-age students may not be able to understand the relationship between a mathematical-looking program and its output. Thus, I created Engram, which teaches both English syntax as well as a version of typical functional programming language syntax. Young English speakers can learn Engram to familiarize themselves with simple English sentence structure and critical programming concepts.
