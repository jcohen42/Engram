The Engram Editor is a Windows-only application where you can write and run code written for Engram. You can save Engram programs to your computer and load them later.

1. **Load from Computer:** After pushing this button, you can select a `.txt` file from your computer. The chosen text file will be put into the **Code Editor** (see item #6).
2. **Save to Computer:** When you sleect this button, you can save the text file in the **Code Editor** to your computer. The default file name is `engram.txt`, but you can change it before saving the file. You do *not* need to save to your computer before running the program you wrote in the **Code Editor**.
3. **Run:** Starts running the program written in the **Code Editor**. All output will be displayed in the **Output Viwer** (see item #7), and when necessary, you can send input to the running program by using the **Input Field** (see item #8). Keep in mind that while the program is running, the **Run** button is disabled, meaning you cannot run a program if one is already runing.
4. **Stop:** The **Stop** button is only active if a program is running. Clicking the **Stop** button terminates the program.
5. **Exit:** Closes the Engram Editor.
6. **Code Editor:** This is where you will write, edit, and debug your Engram code. The **Code Editor** automatically highlights all keywords and numbers. Line numbers are displayed on the left-hand side of the **Code Editor** to aid with any syntax errors that may occur when running your program.
7. **Output Viewer:** Here you can view the output of your program, including any error messages or warnings.
8. **Input Field:** You can type a number into the **Input Field** to send it to your running program. Only numbers are accepted in this field. Once you have typed the number, you can press Enter on your keyboard or press the **Enter** button (see item #9).
9. **Enter:** Sends the number written in the **Input Field** to the running program.
